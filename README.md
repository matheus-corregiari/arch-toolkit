# Arch Toolkit

### Hello World!! \o/

Everybody have those useful files, they are copied and improved on every project, right?

Like utils, adapters, or even some architecture stuff.

What do I have here? Well... I'm trying to extract this things on small libraries. \o/

This is the toolkit that I had used and improved across the projects I worked with. Actually, not
all of them, I'm bringing one by one.

###### For now:

KMP
- **[Splinter](toolkit/multi/splinter)** - WIP
- **[Event Observer](toolkit/multi/event-observer)** - WIP
- **[Lumber](toolkit/multi/lumber)** - WIP

Android
- **[Statemachine](toolkit/android/statemachine)** - A simple way to handle view change states
- **[Recycler-Adapter](toolkit/android/recycler-adapter)** - A Recycler Adapter implementation using Custom
  Views and a "bind" interface
- **[Delegate](toolkit/android/delegate)** - Some custom implementations for delegated properties
- **[Foldable](toolkit/android/foldable)** - Extensions to facilitate handling foldable state changes

###### In progress:

- **Add Tests and code coverage.** (Improvements with CI and delivery)

###### Backlog:

- **Extensions** - Some extensions to speed up your code

I'm trying to publish everything on JCenter, but I'll only publish projects with javadoc and
implemented samples. So if you want use something not published, feel free to copy and paste into
your project.

Take a look in the README files inside the project modules and give it a try. =P You'll find
instructions to add them into your project and how to use them.

###### Have improvements?

Open a pull request! It will make me really really happy!

###### Need some custom behavior or something else?

Open a issue or copy the classes into your project, I think the code is small and simple, you can do
whatever you want with them.

But try to tell me what you miss and then I can improve!! =D
