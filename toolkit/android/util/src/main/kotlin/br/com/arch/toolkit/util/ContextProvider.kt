/**
 * This code defines an object called ContextProvider which is a common way in Kotlin to create a Singleton. This object aims to provide access to a Context throughout an Android application. Let's break down its functionality:
 * 1. lastContext:
 *      - It's a nullable property of type WeakReference<Context>.
 *      - WeakReference is used to hold a reference to a Context (like an Activity or Application) without preventing the garbage collector from reclaiming it if it's no longer needed elsewhere. This helps avoid memory leaks.
 * 2. current:
 *  - This is a computed property that returns the Context held by lastContext if it's still available, or null if the Context has been garbage collected.
 * 3. register(application: Application):
 *      - This function is meant to be called early in your app's lifecycle, ideally within your Application class's onCreate() method.
 *      - It initializes lastContext with a WeakReference to the provided Application context.
 *      - It registers an ActivityLifecycleCallbacks listener to the Application. This listener updates lastContext whenever an Activity is created or resumed, ensuring you have access to the most current Activity context.
 * ## Purpose:
 * The ContextProvider object provides a convenient way to access a valid Context from anywhere in your application. This is often needed for tasks like:
 *      - Inflating layouts
 *      - Accessing resources (strings, drawables, etc.)
 *      - Starting services or other components
 * ## Caveats:
 * - Be mindful of potential memory leaks if you hold a strong reference to the Context returned by current for an extended period.
 * - In some cases, using the Application context might be sufficient and safer than relying on an Activity context, especially if you need the context to persist beyond the lifecycle of a single Activity.
 * ## Example Usage:
 * ```kotlin
 * // In your Application class's onCreate()
 * ContextProvider.register(this)
 *
 * // Elsewhere in your app
 * val context = ContextProvider.current
 * if (context != null) {
 *     // Use the context, e.g., to inflate a layout
 * }
 * ```
